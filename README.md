# About #
It contains .conf files for
- Hyprland
- Waybar
- Ironbar (https://github.com/JakeStanger/ironbar)
- Wofi
- Hypridle
- Hyprlock

All of it works, CSS configuration its unfinished so it looks ugly but its functional

##
Uncomment if you want to use waybar or ironbar (/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf)
```
#exec-once = waybar
exec-once = ~/.cargo/bin/ironbar
```
